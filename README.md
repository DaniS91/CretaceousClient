## A practice exercise corresponding to an Epicodus lesson in the C# course section [Building an API](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net-part-time/building-an-api): [Epicodus chapter beginning client build](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/c-and-net-part-time/building-an-api/configuring-application-urls-to-run-two-asp-net-core-applications). This project uses [Swashbuckle](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/getting-started-with-swashbuckle?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio-code), an implementation of [Swagger](https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/) documentation

#### In this lesson, we built a frontend client for an API called Cretaceous Park sharing data about a wildlife park. We scaffolded an ASP.NET Core mvc with full CRUD capabilities.
